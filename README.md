# KNN-Iris-Classification: 

## üåü Objective

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm for a classification task, fulfilling the requirements of Task 6 for the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship.

The goal was to understand and apply KNN, experiment with the optimal value of *K*, and evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

* **Python:** Programming language environment.
* **Jupyter/Google Colab:** Notebook environment for execution.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn (`sklearn`):** Core library for implementing the `KNeighborsClassifier`, data splitting, scaling, and evaluation metrics.
* **Matplotlib:** For visualization of the K optimization process and decision boundaries.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

* `Task_6_KNN_Classification.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing all the Python code.
* (Optional - replace with your actual file name) `knn_error_rate_plot.png`: Screenshot showing the Error Rate vs. K value used for optimization.
* (Optional - replace with your actual file name) `knn_decision_boundary.png`: Screenshot of the visualized decision boundary.

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1.  **Data Selection:** Used the **Iris Dataset** as a standard classification problem.
2.  **Normalization:** Applied **`StandardScaler`** to normalize the features, which is critical for KNN to ensure all dimensions contribute equally to the distance calculation.
3.  **Data Splitting:** Divided the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
4.  **K Optimization:** Iterated through different values of $K$ (from 1 to 20) to find the optimal $K$ that minimizes the error rate on the test set.
5.  **Model Training:** Trained the final `KNeighborsClassifier` using the **optimal $K$ value**.
6.  **Evaluation:** Calculated the **accuracy score** and generated a **confusion matrix** and **classification report** on the test data.
7.  **Visualization:** Plotted the **decision boundaries** using the first two features (Sepal Length and Sepal Width) to visualize the model's classification regions.

## üìä Key Results

* **Optimal K:** Found the best value of $K$ to be **[Insert Your Optimal K Value Here]**.
* **Test Accuracy:** The final model achieved an accuracy of **[Insert Your Final Accuracy Here]**.

## ‚ùì Interview Questions (Conceptual Understanding)

| Concept | Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| **How KNN works** | It's a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm that classifies a new point based on a **majority vote** of its $K$ nearest neighbors, determined by a distance metric. |
| **Normalization** | Crucial because KNN is based on distance; normalization ensures features on different scales do not dominate the distance calculation. |
| **Choosing K** | Typically done by plotting the error rate vs. $K$ or using cross-validation to find the value that results in the lowest generalization error. |
